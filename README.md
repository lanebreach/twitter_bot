# Lane Breach

This is the public repository for all of the code associated with Lane Breach, a
digital platform for bringing safety to the cyclists riding along the streets of
San Francisco.

## Our Mission

We want to create an online platform that serves as the centerpoint for cyclist
data in San Francisco. By combining datasets from the
[city](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/311-Cases/vw6y-z8j6), the
SFMTA, and the CHP, we hope to paint a complete picture of the dangers that face
bicyclists in the city. This dataset is intended to be used by anyone who wants
a better understanding about what factors lead to the large number of bicycle
incidents on our streets each year.

## Twitter Bot
This service posts weekly stats at @bikelanes_sf. This version pulls data directly from SF311 on a weekly basis.


## Contributing

We welcome contributions! All of our contributors are expected to follow the
rules outlined in our Code of Conduct. Please create a separate pull request
against master for each new feature/bug-fix. We will try to use Github issues
whenever possible to describe tasks that we need to do.

Steps for building the various apps, and an overview of the design can be found
on the wiki. We're excited to see your PRs!
